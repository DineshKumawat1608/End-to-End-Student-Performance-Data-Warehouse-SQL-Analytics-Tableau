# 🎓 End-to-End Student Performance & Attendance Data Warehouse & Analytics Project

This repository showcases an **end-to-end Data Engineering and Analytics project** that transforms raw educational data into meaningful academic insights using a modern data warehouse approach.

The project covers the complete analytics lifecycle—from **building a SQL Server data warehouse**, performing **ETL and data modeling**, to conducting **SQL-based exploratory and advanced analysis**, and finally creating **interactive Tableau dashboards**.

The analysis focuses on:

- Student academic performance
- Attendance patterns and trends
- Homework completion analysis
- Teacher-parent communication insights

This project demonstrates practical, industry-oriented skills in **Data Engineering, SQL Analytics, Data Warehousing, Data Visualization, and Business Intelligence**.

# 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture**, organizing data into **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.

### 🥉 Bronze Layer
- Stores raw student datasets exactly as received from CSV files.
- No transformations are applied.

### 🥈 Silver Layer
- Performs data cleaning, standardization, validation, and deduplication.
- Produces clean and consistent datasets for analytics.

### 🥇 Gold Layer
- Creates business-ready dimension and fact views using a Star Schema.
- Serves as the analytical layer for SQL analysis and Tableau dashboards.

# 📊 Student Performance Dashboard

### Objective

Develop interactive Tableau dashboards that help school administrators and educators monitor academic performance, attendance, homework completion, and student engagement.

The solution consists of **three interactive dashboards** designed for different levels of academic analysis.

### 📌 Executive Overview
Provides a high-level summary of academic performance through KPI cards and interactive visualizations, including:

- Student and subject overview
- Average exam score, attendance, and homework completion
- Attendance and homework status distribution
- Subject-wise and grade-wise performance
- Student demographics
- Monthly academic trends

### 📌 Student Analysis
Supports deeper academic analysis through:

- Highest performing students
- Students requiring improvement
- Attendance by subject
- Homework completion vs. exam score
- Average age vs. exam score
- Teacher-parent communication analysis

### 📌 Student Details
Provides a detailed student-level view including:

- Student profile
- Academic summary
- Attendance summary
- Parent communication
- Student rank
- Contact information
- Dynamic filtering

### Dashboard Features

- Interactive dashboard navigation
- Expandable and collapsible filter panel
- Cross-filtering across visualizations
- Dashboard usage guide
- Clean and responsive layout

These dashboards transform educational data into actionable insights that support informed academic decision-making.
